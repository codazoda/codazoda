## Projects


### Codazoda.com

Goal:
Status: Active
Started: March 2023

This is a website of _failed_ business attemps. Maybe there will be some successes here, eventually.


### Codazoda Coding Videos

Goal: Gain 100 YouTube Followers
Status: Active
Started: January 2023

My primary rationale for this is to motivate myself to _create_ projects regularly. Secondarily I'd like to teach people things and maybe even become "local famous". I originally set-out to create a video every week for three months. I've missed that goal at this point, having missed some of the weeks, but I could pull it back together and finish with 11 video's in three months.

Creating video is _hard_ and I've had almost no success. I gained about 10 new followers while creating 9 videos. Clearly the video's I'm making are not resonating with anyone.

I'm also not accomplishing the original idea of motivating me to create. It's sort-of doing that but creating video is adding a _lot_ of extra stress to that process. Still, I'm considering giving it another three months, switching to bi-weekly, and setting a goal of 100 followers. The only reason to continue is because I want to give it a chance before I switch to something else to motivate myself.

Also, I need to create projects that could possibly be businesses.
