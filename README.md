Err... I accidentally found out that if you have a repo named the same as your GitHub account and it has a `README.md` file, it will show up on your profile page.

> A web of failures

This is a website where I'm going to list my business tries and ultimately failures (because nothing seems to work but I keep trying).

## Building

Some instructions on how I built this site. I'll make a video of these.

- Create a repo
- Create an `index.md` file
- Turn on GitHub pages
- Use the `main` branch
- Use the `/` directory
- Test it with GitHub subdomain
- Setup custom domain
